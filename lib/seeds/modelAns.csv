Dear Dad and Mom,      
How are you both? L'viv, Ukraine, was really cool. I took a tour so that I could understand the history of the gorgeous buildings. When I left L'viv, I learned that few people speak English. In order to eat and find hotels, I'm speaking some Ukrainian and smiling a lot!

"I just saw 'Rear Window.' What an amazing movie! 'Rear Window' was made in 1954 and was directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock. 'Rear Window' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B. is played by James Stewart. L.B. is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. I felt sorry for his poor neighbors! Soon, L.B. begins using his camera to fight evil. I saw the remake in 1998, but it's not the same. Daryl Hannah's acting was dreadful!

"I am proposing a hiring freeze as a way to cut expenses. I know that some people believe that layoffs are a quick way to save money. I think layoffs have more disadvantages than advantages. The biggest disadvantage would be employee morale. Our staff is too important! So, as staff retires or leaves the company, we would not replace them. We would find ways to do our work with the employees we have. I suggest that we meet and talk about my proposal at our next meeting.

"I feel strongly that there are too many commercials on TV in my country. For example, most shows have 20 minutes of commercials an hour. Every 10 minutes, they stop the story to show some commercials. In my opinion, the commercials are also very successful because of the jingles. First, you hear a soda jingle. Soon, you are loudly singing that jingle in the kitchen with a big glass of their soda in your hand. Basically, I can't stand commercials. We need to ask for more restrictions on them.

"In the US, the trend is to give lots of tests to students. I'm all for tests if they're written well, but I'm against them when they have too much importance. For example, it's common for a student to fail the grade if they fail a test.     Another trend is for older people to take college courses. Many 60-year-olds are going back to school. I totally support that idea. Some 18-year-olds aren't even in college. Some of them work for a few years until they figure out what they want to do, and some don't go to college at all.

"I just listened to the song 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward. It's a folk-rock tune, and I think it's pretty catchy. I listened to it five times, and I can't get it out my head. Josh's voice is rough and edgy. He doesn't have much of a range, but he hits a few high notes. I was also a little confused. The mood of the song is kind of happy because of the quick, addictive beat. But I think that the lyrics are political, sad and sentimental. Very interesting! I recommend this music when you want a beat and some politics in one song.  ",1

Most people work 50 hours a week, more or less. It can sometimes be difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. I try not to work too late in the evenings. I also take approximately two weeks' vacation each year.

"My new tablet computer has completely changed my life. First of all, it has positively affected how I work. Before I bought my tablet, I'd been using a desktop computer. When I traveled, I couldn't use any of my applications or work on my projects. The tablet is so powerful that I can be productive wherever I am.     Secondly, the tablet has made me rethink texting. I had been texting from my smartphone, which was difficult and slow, as the keyboard was so small. The tablet allows me to text quickly with a larger, more normal keyboard – and I can use the same software. It's true that the tablet computer was very expensive, but I'm really glad I got it.

He was very attractive, and he seemed very nice. Plus, I loved his French accent. We talked a bit during the flight, and I thought that was it. Just as I was getting off the plane, he stopped me and asked if I would join him for a glass of wine that evening. I'm normally not very adventurous, but I said yes. I was in Paris, and why not? We were married nine months later, and now I call Paris my home.

I ordered the asparagus quiche, and it came with a side of spicy corn on the cob. It was unbelievable! As soon as we finished the main course, we both ordered the cheesecake brownie. It was two classic desserts in one! The food was definitely not low-fat, but the chef said that it's mostly local and organic. Everything was delicious and unusual, so we'll probably go again.

The owner made a counteroffer of $230,000. We said that we were sorry, but we just didn't have the money. We also told the owner how much we loved the house and wished her good luck. We continued to look at other houses, but couldn't find anything we loved. Then, suddenly, we heard from the owner. The house was ours for $200,000. I asked her why. She said that one other couple had offered more, but she decided to sell it to us because we loved the house so much. We were very happy in that house.

"In my country, we have very strict laws about driving and drinking alcohol. I think the laws are so strict because, in the past, there were many terrible accidents caused by drinking and driving. The first time the police catch you drinking and driving, you lose your license. You can also go to jail. A friend of mine lost his license, and he's really angry because it's difficult for him to get to work. I think the laws might be a little bit too strict, but the number of accidents has decreased dramatically. People are afraid to drink and drive, and that's a good thing.

- Clean your plate

- Take off your shoes at the door, unless your host asks you to     
- Smoke, unless you know your host also smokes. Even then, only smoke when he or she does

"Is gender equality still a hot topic in the UK? You bet. There are many women in leading roles in business, art and politics, but it could be said these women are over-achieving, and that most women do not share in this success.     In 2010, men still earned 10 percent more than women; yet in 1943, when women worked in industry and manufacturing during World War II, it must have seemed so different.     When Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979, the role of women in society was not clearly defined. She was nicknamed 'the Iron Lady,' which surely is a sexist term, as it refers to her gender. When she died in 2013, Britons were not sure how they felt. Was she a hero, or not? Perhaps this was more about her politics than her gender. It's still a question asked about women in power in the UK today.

"   The last couple of years have been difficult for my country. The biggest factor was that the bottom dropped out of the financial market, and a lot of people lost their jobs. Unemployed people don't pay taxes, so it's been difficult for the government as well. Most people were happy just to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. Unfortunately, many people lost their homes because they couldn't pay their mortgages. Things seem to be turning around now. More people are picking up work, and the government is collecting more taxes from people who are working again. Things are looking up, but I think people will be thriftier in the future.  ",1
"I recently attended a presentation about team procedures. I have to admire how calm the presenter was. Her voice was clear, and she looked at people around the room instead of just staring at her notes. Another thing she did well was to summarize her key points in the conclusion. I left the presentation remembering each important idea. And her flowcharts were compelling. One of them perfectly explained a procedure I had never really understood before.   On the other hand, one thing she could have done differently was to grab people's attention during the opening. If she had given us an interesting fact or figure, for example, I think some people would have felt more motivated. Finally, I would have liked it if she had given more examples of the payroll procedures. I'm still not sure how to complete a time report. Overall, the presentation was very helpful and well-prepared.

If you can believe it, my parents went white-water rafting last year. My mother said it was absolutely amazing, and my father said it was a rush. After that, I decided it was time for me to try something as well, or I'd never hear the end of it. I took some training in rock climbing, and I was surprised how much I loved it. I didn't know what I was missing. Honestly, I regret that I didn't start a lot earlier. Next for me is surfing. I do have a fear of the ocean, but I am going to face my fear.

"I have a really good life. I'm a science instructor at a state university, and my husband and I own a new, comfortable house. My parents live nearby, so I get to spend time with them. I have a certain amount of stress from work, although I do take summers off. As far as money goes, I occasionally get a little nervous because our house payments are quite high. Fortunately, we don't have to live from paycheck to paycheck. The fact is we've got everything we need and more. However, sometimes I feel that something is missing. You see, my husband and I don't have children. Our social life is rather slow. As a result, I get a little lonely. Last year, I thought long and hard about whether I wanted to adopt a child. I even called an adoption agency. In the end, I decided I was just having a mid-life crisis.

If only I had done that sooner, I would have realized that volunteering is a great way to network and meet people. Soon afterward, I had interviews at several companies whose employees had also volunteered. Following the interviews, I was offered a job with a large homebuilder. I was always determined to work in the real estate industry in some way, shape or form. I gladly took the job and have remained passionate about my work ever since, although, frankly, things were difficult in the years after the bubble burst. For the last five years, I have been negotiating purchase contracts at a successful real estate development company in the valley. As soon as the market picks up enough, I hope to open my own development company.

"The smartphone my wife gave me was a bit of a surprise. I already had a phone, but not a 'smart' one. At first, I wasn't sure about it. I thought it might be overwhelming. I'm certainly no tech expert. However, I've had the phone for a month now, and I can honestly say I don't know what I'd do without it. I've become dependent on it. I use it to keep in touch by text, phone and email with my family and friends; I'm able to access the internet when I need news or information; and I love to take pictures. One big advantage is that the phone has a built-in camera. I can take a picture and immediately send it to friends. The quality of the photos is surprisingly good. Let me see – are there any downsides? Well, maybe one: I'm having some kind of problem with the battery. It just doesn't last very long. I have to charge it every two or three days.

"I used to not think about life too much. I mean, I was happy and everything, but I never really thought about what was important. Well, that all changed last year when my mother died. It was completely unexpected. She had a heart attack, and that was it. It took me a very long time to deal with her death, but in the end I actually learned some valuable lessons. My mother lived every day as if it were her last. She never wasted time worrying, complaining or being angry about things. She always tried to see the good in things and be positive. She told me that I should do the same. What I know now is that every single day of your life is, in fact, very important: it's a gift that shouldn't be wasted. My mother didn't waste time on stupid or unimportant things, and I'm not going to do that, either.

"Growing up with my grandmother in West Java, Indonesia, I heard inspiring stories from the Wayang Kulit, which is our native puppet theater. Wayang Kulit is an 800-year-old performance art unique to Indonesia culture. The Wayang are flat puppets that are attached to a stick, different from the puppets that look like humans attached to strings. The puppeteer cuts exquisite, complex facial and body patterns into each of his puppets. A puppeteer takes weeks drawing, cutting and painting a puppet, but it's well worth his time. For the performance, always under a warm night sky, the puppeteer sits next to a cotton screen in front of an oil light. He holds his puppets up against the screen. The oil light streams through each puppet, creating mysterious, dancing shadows on the screen. Frankly, there's absolutely nothing else like Wayang Kulit in the world. Thanks to the puppeteer's expert control and choreography, the shadow puppets traditionally perform for about eight hours, telling the audience universal stories of life and death, and good winning over evil.

"We have a lot of farmers in my country. We also have a lot of wolves. From a social point of view, I think it's safe to say that farmers and wolves don't get along. Wolves kill farmers' animals, and so farmers kill wolves.  Wolves are endangered now, which means there aren't a lot of them left. So the government made a new law that it's illegal to kill a wolf. From an environmental point of view, the law is probably a good idea, but what about the farmers? If a farmer shoots a wolf now, he's a criminal. He has to pay a fine, or he might even go to prison. To my mind, that's not fair. The farmers have rights, too. If you ask me, making laws is a complicated business, and as many people as possible need to be involved. There has to be a way that makes everybody happy. Maybe the farmers could get compensation if one of their farm animals is killed? Maybe the local authority could send in people to catch the wolf so the farmer didn't have to kill it? Whatever the solution is, let's hope it suits both farmers and wolves.

"When I was growing up, I read books printed on paper. I'd read anything –  graphic novels; autobiographies; nature magazines; and my favorite, crime fiction. Somewhere along the way, I've transitioned from paper to electronic media. In the early 2000s, I read my first e-book. It was a 1930s classic: 'Their Eyes Were Watching God,' written by Zora Neale Hurston, written before digital communications media was even born. Now, I read my novels and news on a tablet. I do research for work on search engines, blogs, magazines and online dictionaries.     I've noticed some huge differences in my habits, too. With paper media, I would use my fingers to turn a page; with electronic media, I tap or swipe my screen to go to the next page. Sometimes news articles contain links. I can tap the link and be taken to an entirely new world of information. In fact, I do a different finger dance made from a complex series of taps and swipes to accomplish certain goals. None of this was possible with paper books and, frankly, sometimes all this digital interaction can become a little distracting. In all, however, I enjoy it.

"In the UK, even in this day and age, table manners are considered important. This applies even more when you're eating in a formal situation at someone's house. First of all, if you have any special diet requirements, your hosts will expect to be told about them in advance. Do not spring any last-minute surprises. Take a small gift with you: A bottle of wine, flowers or chocolates are all acceptable. Wait until your hosts begin eating, or they say it's okay for you to do so; this shows that you are considerate. Don't make phone calls or send text messages while you are at the table. It's considered extremely bad manners. When it comes to cutlery, the soup spoon is generally on the right, to the outside of the knife; the fork is on the left; and the dessert spoon is above the dinner plate. However, if you are not sure which of the silverware to use, you can employ a strategy I use myself when in similar situations: Watch what others do, and then do that, too. Good luck, and enjoy your meal!

"To create a successful project and solid teamwork, I propose that companies use the SWOT analysis technique. SWOT helps a business evaluate internal and external strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Let's say you carry out a SWOT analysis at the beginning of a project. The first thing is to make sure that project goals are clear. Then, I'd say you should make a list of questions to satisfy each element of the SWOT analysis. You want to make sure all the major project tasks are covered and identify possible risks.      My thought then would be to take SWOT even further. Team members could collaborate on a SWOT analysis of the team itself, making them a stronger team and developing mutual trust. For example, if the team spends time identifying their strengths, then the resulting information can actually motivate the team. And, as they identify weaknesses, they become more aware of how to prevent future problems.      Once you complete a SWOT analysis, I suggest that you review it frequently. Change the questions and answers as the market changes, and focus on taking advantage of your strengths and opportunities and reducing your weaknesses and threats.

"What makes a successful leader is hard to define. Take me, for example. Most of my adult life I was more of a follower than a leader. I've always had a hard time persuading others, and I lack most of the characteristics that we associate with a strong leader, like charisma and drive. It wasn't until five years ago, when I was hired by a new company and ended up in a management training course, that things began to change for me. At first, I thought I would never be able to develop leadership qualities. Among the biggest challenges for me was just feeling comfortable in front of a large group. But the leader of the course earned my trust and, before I knew it, I was being asked to help others. Now I'm the manager of my department, and my boss is very happy with my performance. I don't think I'm the best leader in the world, but my staff respects me and I feel confident. The most important thing that I've learned is this: Never underestimate yourself.

"English, my second language, has played a major role in my life. I learned the most English between ages 6 and 12. My family lived in the US during those years, and I studied and used English in an international school. In school, I had to write essays in English. I spoke English every day after school as I played with the children in my neighborhood. We sang songs and played games, all in English. I was keen to learn English because it helped me make friends I never would have had.      I soon realized that English gave me more than new friends. English also gave me better opportunities in life. I was accepted at Duke University in the US, which is a well-respected school. A major reason I was accepted was because I was fluent in English. I think that the university appreciated that I am also fluent in French, my native tongue. After I graduated from Duke, I moved back to France to be with my family. There, I had a number of employment opportunities because my English was so good. Beyond giving me better opportunities, English has simply made my life more enjoyable.

"My girlfriend used to date this guy in her office. They broke up after almost 18 months. It was a bit tough for both of them after that, working in the same office and seeing each other every day, but they ended up being really good friends. I wish all relationships could end like that. The guy eventually met someone else, and they ended up getting married. My girlfriend was even invited to the wedding, but she didn't go because the guy's new wife hates her. The wife knows about the previous relationship, and she's really jealous. Anyway, the other night my girlfriend was at the same party as this guy, and she wanted to congratulate him for getting a promotion, so she gives him a big hug. No kiss or anything – she just put her arms around him. Just at that moment, the wife walks up and gets really jealous. My girlfriend said her face was all red. She was so angry that she threw her glass of wine in her husband's face and ran off. Can you believe it? Talk about awkward!

"I became aware of the importance of office politics when I was up for my last promotion. My colleague had spent a lot of time networking, and had become involved with some exciting projects. She got the promotion; I didn't. Obviously, she was more than just talented and sociable: she was an expert at office politics. By contrast, I work hard, but I'm shy and quiet. Of course, my personality and habits put me in a bad position when it's time for a promotion.      

Since then, I've tried harder to play the game. For example, I like my colleague who got the promotion, so I've been collaborating with her. Once in a while, I'll ask her for advice. Indeed, she's become my mentor. One of the things she's taught me is that office politics isn't necessarily a war. You don't have to compromise your ideals. You can achieve what you want without being deceptive or placing blame. Instead, get to know your colleagues. Show them respect. Try to understand their ideas. Chat with your boss. He or she can be your biggest advocate. Admittedly, I'm still sometimes uncomfortable practicing office politics. Nevertheless, it has helped me grow as an employee.

"I think most people would agree that successful people are passionate, persistent and probably pretty competitive. The thing that strikes me, however, is that you can have these traits, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be successful. I think you also need to have a great idea or some kind of vision that nobody else has. When I think of successful people, I think of Steve Jobs. People say he could lose his temper and didn't always listen to others, but he had fantastic ideas. That's what mattered more than anything else.      I guess it's true that he surrounded himself with incredibly talented people, but who wouldn't want to work with him? He could pick and choose who he wanted to work with because he had the ideas. He also understood what people wanted, maybe before people even knew what they wanted themselves. That was his genius. He could imagine the world in a way that no one else could and make it become a reality. His passion, his creativity and his inner drive made him one of the most successful and innovative people of our generation.

"The historic architecture of Bruges, in Belgium, is marvelous. The city is well-known for its Gothic buildings, with their pointed arches and celebratory spires, built in roughly between the 13th and 16th centuries. Some of the most exquisite buildings are centered around Market Square, the heart of the city. If you visit Bruges, I recommend you stay in the Grand Hotel Casselbergh, an 18th-century building with a contemporary wing that blends in beautifully. The hotel is conveniently situated in the center of the old city.           

Near the Casselbergh is the fabulous City Hall, the oldest city hall in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. There's also the Church of Our Lady, which houses a lovely Michelangelo sculpture and is also the tallest building in the city. The spire itself is 122 meters! There is one modern building worth mentioning: the somewhat overwhelming Concertgebouw, a concert hall. Although I'm pleased the city decided to construct something that reflects the current time, the building itself is not all that inspiring, in my opinion. Overall, however, I have no doubt that you will completely enjoy a trip to Bruges and learn much about world history from our unique city.

"The whole question of CSR is a difficult one. There are powerful arguments on both sides of the issue.      On the one hand, it can be argued that corporations owe nothing to society other than running their businesses, paying taxes and following the laws of the country. The job of taking care of society is for the government. People don't ask politicians to make products, so why should we ask companies to solve society's problems?      

On the other hand, companies have a big impact on society. If a company's factory pollutes the environment, then it should pay to clean it up. If a company hires workers, it should provide fair pay and benefits. Companies can also help the communities where they operate. After all, that community is letting them do business there. It's a two-way street.      

Personally, I'm in the middle. I think a company has to follow the law and be held responsible if it does something that negatively affects people or a community, but I also think you can't force companies to do good. Corporations can be a force for good in the world, but only if they decide that it's in their own best interest.  ",1
"Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging.      

I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

I'm writing to update you on our progress. I'm sure you will be glad to know that we have tested the samples and determined that the quality is excellent. Although we identified an issue with some of the packaging materials, we immediately fixed it.      

Marketing then sent the samples to seven key partners for further testing. Once we receive the feedback, we will develop several marketing campaigns for your review. We plan to mail the materials to you on July 15th; alternatively, you could visit our headquarters after July 15 to discuss them. In either case, it's critical that we receive your comments by July 22.      

I can arrange a meeting for you and Mr. Salas to touch base the week of August 8th. Could you let me know whether that works for you?      

Please contact me with any concerns.      

Best regards,

"ASEAN stands for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. This is an agreement that was signed in the late 1960s by five countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Since that time, several more countries have joined ASEAN, including Vietnam and Cambodia.      

ASEAN is mainly concerned with free trade and improving the economies of its member countries. Trade among the members has increased significantly since the agreement was signed. ASEAN also focuses on environmental issues like controlling air pollution and keeping the ocean clean. Almost all of its members have coastlines or are islands. The agreement also tries to promote peace in the region. The members believe that closer economic cooperation and increased trade will make war much less likely.      ASEAN should not be confused with another acronym, APEC. APEC stands for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. This agreement was signed into law in 1989 and has more than 20 members, including the US, China and Australia. APEC also promotes free trade. One of its other main concerns is improving the living standards and education of people in Asia-Pacific countries.

"Petty crimes in the US may include purse-snatching or shoplifting. Many petty crimes in the US are punished with fines, although some people may lose privileges, including a professional license. If you are sentenced to jail for a petty crime, you might be incarcerated for one year or less. Youth aged 18 and under are sent to juvenile detention. This is true for most of the country, unless you live in certain states, like Massachusetts, where the maximum is 2.5 years. After punishment, many petty crimes can be erased from a person's criminal record so that the individual can lead a normal life. However, some more serious crimes, like drunk driving, cannot. These types of cases need to remain on record in case there is recidivism. Generally, petty crime is considered less serious. The court delivers a minor punishment mainly so that the individual will admit he or she has made a mistake and think twice before committing another crime. The hope is that the individual will be rehabilitated.

"Dear Elizabeth,      

We've selected an ad campaign for Century watches. I'm sure you'll love our choice of campaigns.      

Many people think that Century is a classic and well-known brand, because it has featured some of the most famous stars in advertising campaigns. While this might be true, it's also true customers prefer Century because it's simply the best and most reliable watchmaker on the market. That's the reason why Century has managed to be one of the top watchmakers worldwide.      

Considering Century's trend of working with famous stars, we contemplated the idea of bringing a celebrity into the campaign. We decided, however, that the quality of the watch was more important than celebrity endorsement. For this reason, we decided that the ad would feature a man playing golf, simple and crystal-clear, but with a slogan that delivers an efficient message; a message not directed to stars and athletes, but directed to each and every man that will read and look at our ad. ""Golf and Century. The perfect team."" It's a simple message that everyone can understand.      

I look forward to hearing from you regarding our decision.      Best regards …

"Wind power      

In my opinion, wind power would be the most effective form of natural power to meet our city's energy needs.      

As you know, our city is located by the sea. We have three hundred and sixty-five windy days a year. Wind power creates no waste and does not use any fossil fuels or other kinds of finite energy. It is low-cost and highly profitable.      

The cost of installing wind turbines would come to only 80,000 dollars, and the maintenance costs would be low. It would be better than solar power, as it creates less carbon, and it would be more efficient than using a 'Natural living machine' because the wind turbines would need fewer people to look after them, and therefore would be more cost-effective.      

All in all, as far as I'm concerned, wind power would be the most environmentally friendly and economically viable way to produce renewable energy for our city.

"I have a friend who's attending a university in the United States. We often discuss the similarities and differences between university life in the US and in our own country.     

 One of the big differences is flexibility. My friend tells me it's fairly common to change your major in the US. This is not the case in my country. Unlike the US system, it is very difficult to change your major. Being able to easily change majors makes sense to me, as a person's interests might change as well.      Another thing my friend tells me that's different is the level of formality. Even though professors are respected, they can also be your friend. Students in some classes actually socialize with their professors. By comparison, I don't think I would ever go to a party or restaurant with one of my teachers.      

Just so you don't think everything is different, my friend tells me that students in America are pretty much like students in our country. They want to get a good education so they can get a good job and have a happy life, but they also want to have fun. That's something I think we can all agree on.

To begin, I'd like to tell you about the first time I met Doug. Jessica hadn't told me they were dating. The manager of our downtown office had been telling me for months about his star employee, Doug, and I finally stopped by the office to meet him. Well, when I stepped into Doug's cubicle, he introduced himself as if I knew about him and Jessica dating. Never have I seen someone turn so red!

"I got stuck in an elevator yesterday, and it reminded me of a story about a pizza-delivery guy who got stuck in an elevator for days. Have you heard that one?      

So, this guy is sent to deliver pizzas to several apartment buildings, but he never comes back to work. His employer calls the people the guy was supposed to deliver to. They all say that they received their orders. Next, he calls the police to see if there have been any bicycle accidents: nothing. Feeling more and more desperate, the employer visits all the buildings the guy delivered to. He still finds nothing. After 24 hours, the police declare the guy a missing person and start to investigate.      Finally, in one of the buildings the guy delivered to, the security people are checking video camera footage and realize that he's stuck in an elevator. It's been more than 40 hours! The guy was OK. He was thirsty and tired, and he joked that the elevator didn't smell too good. He also thought it was ironic that he'd just delivered his last pizza before he got stuck. One of those pizzas sure would have been useful.

"Last night, Serena Nelson, 38, stabbed her husband with the knife she was using to make his sandwiches. The police were told she had not intended to seriously hurt her husband when they started arguing about her plans to launch a lunch-delivery business. The police were also told Mrs. Nelson had suffered frequent verbal and physical abuse from her husband.     

On the night of the stabbing, Mr. Nelson was sitting on a stool in the kitchen of the couple's home. Mrs. Nelson pointed out to the police that it was he who started the argument, not her. Serena Nelson moved toward her husband, intending to slap him to stop him shouting, but her husband just laughed. It was then that she picked up the knife, which she had been using to make the sandwiches.      

Mrs. Nelson turned toward her husband, holding the knife. The knife, which had an eight-and-a-half-inch blade, entered his chest. Mrs. Nelson was said to have been 'hysterical' while dialing the emergency services. Her husband was later pronounced dead in hospital.

"Communication in my country is generally indirect. By that I mean people don't like to make very direct statements for fear of offending or upsetting others. This can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. You have to become skilled at reading between the lines to understand what someone is really trying to say.      Along with this indirect style of communication, goes a rather formal use of body language. People in my country don't make a lot of gestures while speaking. One gesture we do often use is the thumbs-up; that means 'great' or 'OK,' which I think is the same everywhere.      In some countries, it's common to put a hand on another's shoulder, or even hug, but that kind of behavior makes people feel uncomfortable in my country. You need to have known someone a long time before there's any physical contact.      The best advice I could give to someone visiting my country is, when first meeting someone, to hold back a bit. Watch what other people do, and listen a lot. Rather than ask a lot of questions, wait to be asked questions. And, like I said, try not to be too physical in your interactions.

"There are definitely both pros and cons associated with superstores, but I think we have to be realistic about the circumstances of some communities.      

I understand the argument that superstores create primarily low-wage jobs and provide few if any social or health benefits to those same workers. I also understand that these giant stores could possibly bankrupt smaller stores that are unable to compete with them. I think just about everyone knows this to be true.      

On the other hand, if a community is already in economic trouble, with few jobs available and people struggling, saying 'no' to a superstore doesn't seem to make any sense at all. Isn't a low-wage job better than no job at all? And, if a community is struggling, wouldn't the lower prices that a superstore can offer help those most in need?      

I want to reiterate that I understand that superstores are not the answer for every community. Different communities have different circumstances and different needs. All I'm saying is that, under certain circumstances, a superstore might do more good than harm for a struggling community.

"I believe that in 25 years' time, the technology we already have will become more and more advanced, adding additional functionality to things that we already have, like cellphones.  For example, rather than having to show your gym card to use the facilities, retinal scanning is likely to become more common, even with portable devices. Mobile technology is already in the running to replace PCs and desktop computers, and I think more and more people will soon be on board with it.      

Ideas like GPS autopilot and artificial intelligence are still likely to be in development at that time, although I'm sure many advances will have been made.  The future of the gas-powered car is still uncertain in my mind, since hybrid and small electric vehicles are increasing in popularity even now. Other types of eco-friendly and safety-related technology are bound to increase, especially with the development of things like wearable computing devices. I don't know about you, but I'm really looking forward to a tech-savvy future!

"Senator Accused Of Taking Bribes

Senior senator's long relationship with construction firm under scrutiny
State Senator William Grimes has been accused of taking bribes in the awarding of state construction projects. Firms competing for state projects have long complained that Grimes has shown favoritism toward Universal Construction. This comes after news reports that Grimes' wife has been on the payroll of Universal for more than two years.           

Lawyers representing several firms that have lost out on state projects argue that Grimes' wife being on the Universal payroll is a conflict of interest at best, and criminal bribe-taking at worst. They are urging state legislators to open an investigation immediately.           

""When the last big state project was awarded to Universal, I said enough is enough!"" declared the CEO of Precision Construction, a competitor of Universal. ""I know for a fact that our bid was competitive with Universal, but we didn't get a fair hearing."" Other business leaders and legislators have claimed to have suffered similar discrimination.           

Grimes' office refused to comment on the allegations, but did say, ""Senator Grimes has always acted in the best interests of our state and will continue to do so.""

"Robots help perform more than 300,000 surgeries per year in the US. They explore places humans can't, such as the deepest parts of oceans and space. But most often, robots perform routine, assembly-line jobs that increase productivity and lower costs, like packaging produce or attaching wheels to cars.      

Robots perform an increasingly large proportion of menial tasks in the US, which I feel is a promising trend. The result is that companies can keep more jobs in the country and increase the number of jobs that require higher-level skills. Jobs that require these skills will still need to be performed by humans, at least in the foreseeable future.      

I think there is a major downside to this trend, however. As robots replace people doing manual work that can be completed by computers – jobs usually held by poor and middle-class people – the line that separates the poor and rich will become that much more evident. As this trend continues, we need to figure out how to add robots to create an optimal workforce instead of using them simply to replace humans.

"I don't want to name names, but there is a certain male singer who I think is nothing but a media-hogging opportunist. He loves to champion the cause of Housing for Humanity, the charity that builds affordable homes for the poor, but I know something that many people don't.      

A good friend of mine also volunteers at Housing for Humanity, and she saw this singer arrive the other day to supposedly work on the construction of a new home.

"I believe that the creative writing techniques introduced here could be useful for many types of writing. In my line of work, the 'questioning' technique comes in handy. I use it so often and so instinctively that I have to admit that I no longer think of it as a technique. You see, I write technology articles for a weekly banking magazine and use a common journalistic approach: answering the five 'wh-' questions as you write the first paragraph of the story. That way, you anticipate the most salient questions your readers might have about the story.      

A technique I'd like to formally experiment with is loop writing. Sometimes, when I'm trying to formulate the first, critical paragraph for my story, it's difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. I don't always know what the most relevant information is until I sort through all of the details. Loop writing would allow me to think through all of the details, summarize them, rethink them and summarize them again. I believe that final summary could give me a jump-start on a powerful lead paragraph.

"My husband and I are lucky enough to own our own home. We have good jobs and a solid credit history. When my father died, he left me some money and we used that as a down payment on a home loan. I feel very fortunate.      

Before looking for a home, we had to sit down with a mortgage broker. We needed to be 'pre-approved' for a home loan so we could actually make an offer on a home if we found one.  The process was very complicated, requiring an incredible amount of paperwork.      

When we were finally ready to start looking, we contacted a real estate broker. He showed us more than 15 homes. Once or twice we found a home that we liked, but before we had a chance to consider making an offer, the home was gone, purchased by someone else. We finally found a lovely home in our price range and our offer was accepted. Looking back, it was far from easy, but owning our own home makes all the trouble well worth it.

It's so easy to feel like I'm caught in a trap, waking with the alarm, racing off to work and then coming home, only to collapse with exhaustion. Sometimes work stress is so overwhelming that it makes me feel all of my hope has run dry. Most fortunately, there's a serene Japanese garden next to our office. Every few hours, I'll take a break and walk around the Zen garden, breathing the fresh air, smelling the pine trees and taking in the soothing colors. Among the pines, you pick up the sweet sound of small birds as they sing and skip through the needles. A small waterfall spilling onto black stone further enchants the senses – and the imagination. The Japanese garden usually gives me such a sense of peace and wellbeing that I can return to work refreshed and ready to give my best to the task ahead.

"Leprechauns have a long history as a part of Irish folklore, and are considered to be lucky, if very reclusive, creatures. They are often pictured as very short, closer to a child's height than an adult's, with bright red hair and a red beard. They are usually shown wearing a green suit and narrow, pointed shoes.       

Legend has it that leprechauns hide all of their gold in pots at the end of rainbows, and those who can find it will be rich. It's also believed by some that if a human catches a leprechaun, the leprechaun has the power to grant three wishes to the human, in exchange for the leprechaun's freedom.       

While there have been no reported sightings of leprechauns in modern times, these creatures are a common theme in children's stories and are often mentioned at the sight of a rainbow.     

Whether or not you actually believe in the existence of creatures such as leprechauns, they are certainly an interesting aspect of the history and culture of a country. So much so that, in modern times, you will be more likely to see them in the advertising material for tourist attractions than at the end of a rainbow!

Don't worry, flying is easy.

Bring your passport and e-ticket to the airport. First you need to check-in. Show your passport and e-ticket to the check-in clerk. The check-in clerk will give you your boarding pass.

Next you need to go through security. Give your boarding pass and passport to the security officer. The security officer will check your passport.   Then put your hand luggage through the security check.

When you are boarding the plane, give the flight attendant your boarding pass. Fill-in the arrival card during the flight and give it to the customs officer when you arrive in New York. 

Enjoy your flight!

It is a bit strange but they do not allow us to wear watches, but it’s not a problem as they have clocks all over the school. The hardest thing for me is the shoes.

It was an amazing place and we had a really exciting time. We also had a kind of scary experience too!     We took the ferry to one of the small islands; while we were on the way, we got talking to a friendly man called Hiro. He told us that he was a scuba diver and that the island we were going to was a famous diving spot. It was a beautiful place; there was only one small town and the then just blue sea and white sand - perfect!

We found a campsite right next to the beach and decided to stay there as the weather was so nice. We hired a tent, set it up, and then went straight to the beach for a swim. We had a great time on the beach but when we walked back to the campsite, we noticed that the weather had changed and there was a strong wind. By the time we got to the campsite, it was getting a bit scary and then we saw a police car parked near our tent. The police said that a huge typhoon was coming soon and that we could not stay in the tent because it was too dangerous! We didn't know what to do, so we walked back into town feeling worried. When we got to the town, everyone was preparing for the typhoon and we saw Hiro running across the street. When we told him that we had nowhere to stay, he told us to come with him. He took us to the small scuba diving shop in town and introduced us to his friends there. They were very kind and said that we could sleep in the shop if we wanted to.      That night everyone stayed together in the shop. We were so lucky that Hiro was there to help - Hiro was our hero!      In hindsight, camping was a bad idea; we should have checked the weather forecast first. We have learned that planning properly is important but also that people around the world are kind and will help each other. Overall, a good life experience that we will remember for years!

I have just returned from an awful trip with your company. The holiday did not deliver on any of it's promises. The whole experience was completely different from what was promised in your holiday brochure.
The service was dreadful. The captain wasn't friendly and he was always late to leave every morning. The ship was old and disgusting. It was not a cruise ship, it was more like a fishing boat. It was definitely not comfortable and cozy. And it broke down often. The engine broke and wasted a lot of our time.

There were almost no animals to see. We only saw eagles. Where were the polar bears?      And also, there was the problem of the extra expenses. We were told that the holiday was all inclusive but then at the end of the trip we were asked to pay extra fees for insurance.

"Introduction: The debate was about how smaller grocery stores are closing down because larger multinational supermarket are taking their customers.

The debate: Both opponents were very passionate about their beliefs. The spokesperson for small stores was very emotional. He had lost his family business to one of the larger chains and pointed out that small stores couldn’t compete with the low costs of the chains. The spokesperson for the larger chains explained that in the dynamic environment we live in today, people are simply too busy to go to 5 or 6 different places to do their grocery shopping. Larger supermarkets are simply more convenient for the shoppers of this day and age.

Impression:   I enjoyed the debate. Each person gave a very good argument about their beliefs. I would rather that they set aside some time for listeners to call in and give their opinions or ask questions. The presenter was also a little one sided, defending the smaller stores whenever he had the opportunity. Although I think it’s good for the presenter to have an opinion I would prefer it if he remained neutral.

Conclusion: Overall, I felt the debate was very touching. My own view is that it is more convenient to shop at larger stores. However, as small store keepers pointed out, the quality of products such as meats were better in their stores. I’m undecided about which side I’m on but the debate itself was well worth listening to. I’d give it 8 out of 10.  ",1

"Tsunami guidelines

If a tsunami is approaching, the alarm will sound. 
Keep your radio on at all times and follow the instructions.
When you hear the alarm:
Look at the evacuation map to find the nearest stairway.
Do not use the elevator.
Get out of the building and move to higher ground.
If you are on the beach, don't stay there. Move to higher ground. 
Do not wait to see the wave. You won't be able to escape. 

After the tsunami:
Don't drink the water as it may be contaminated.
Stay away from the beach and stay on higher ground.
If you stay calm and follow these guidelines, you'll stay safe.

My name is Cliff and I survived the earthquake last week. It measured 7 on the Richter scale. First I will tell you what happened and then I will answer your questions.

Well, first we felt the ground shaking. During the earthquake, I saw my colleagues getting under their desks and standing in doorways. Many of them looked scared. I got under my desk. Then the security guards told us to evacuate the building, Moments after we had all got out the building, it collapsed. A few of my colleagues were hit by falling debris. I gave them a bandage and helped them stay calm.

The ground was still shaking and cracks had appeared in the road. We were told to get to an open space in order to avoid falling debris. After ten minutes the emergency services arrived. We helped them rescue others trapped in other buildings.

It was a very frightening experience. I feel lucky to be alive.

"New York City is one of the most expensive cities to live in in the United States, so I'd like to move to Miami. Wages are lower in Miami, but you don't need as much money to live there. Renting a place to live, buying food, and even going out on the weekends are much cheaper than in New York. And the weather is great, too. But public transportation isn't as good, and I might have to buy a car to get to work and around town.  ",1
"Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to enquire about the possibility of obtaining a loan from your institution.

I currently rent an apartment at the rate of $500 a month, but I feel that it would be a sound financial move for me to purchase my own home.
I am looking at houses between $100,000 and $120,000.  Currently, I have $20,000 for a down payment, and will be able to afford $600-$800 a month for monthly payments.

I kindly request that you send me any available information on your loan programs, so that I may learn more about your services.  Please contact me at the above address at your convenience.

Best Regards,

"My bedroom now has more of a traditional look, but it's not really my style.  I have a large, dark wood carved headboard, a large matching wardrobe, and two side tables.  It feels a bit old fashioned to me, so if I could change it, I'd go with a calming look.  I love the idea of a relaxing living space with blue hues throughout and natural grain wood.  I don't usually like tan, but I think in combination with blue, or as an accent in the textiles, it would help bring warmth to the space.'

"The first time I went abroad was terrifying. I was 19 years old, and was going to New Zealand with my brother. I couldn’t speak English very well but that was the least of my worries. The real scary part was flying. I had never been on a plane, and was so nervous. Once the plane had taken off I felt a bit better, but then the pilot came on and told us to fasten our seat belts. He said that we were going to pass through a lightning storm and should expect turbulence. At that time I had no idea what ‘turbulence’ meant. Before I could ask what was happening the plane started shaking up and down. At times it felt like we were going to fall from the sky. I was absolutely terrified and thought I was going die. Lightning flashed everywhere; it was so close to the plane I could almost feel it. I had never seen anything like it. Finally, the sky cleared and the plane stopped shaking but I didn’t. In fact I am shaking now just telling the story.

"Today, I'd like to look at the growing markets in Europe, Asia, and South America.  If we look at the period between 2006 and 2008 we can follow the trends in these three developing markets.   Let's look at Europe first, where the market was steady in 2006 and 2007 with a 4% falling off in 2008.  Share prices remained stable.  As you can see, the teen / adult markets remained the same for 2 years then fell by about 50% from 23% in 2006 to 12% in 2008.   Next, Asia, where we can see a dramatic downturn of 20% from 2006 to 2008, but share prices remained relatively stable.  Again, we can see a dramatic fall in 2006 from 15 / 10% in 2006 to 5 / 2% in 2008 in the teen / adult market.   Finally, South America, where we see a dramatic increase in our market share from 12% in 2006 to 33% in 2008.  Share prices also made a dramatic leap from $3 in 2006 to $9 in 2008.  The teen / adult market also shows a sharp rise from 6 / 3 % in 2006 to 43 / 22% in 2008.   In conclusion, I would like to say that we should concentrate our efforts in the South American market and consolidate the gains we have made there.        ",1
"Hi Y

Thanks for the texts and the links to those sports places. I’ve had a look at them and here’s what I think:

1. You don’t enjoy team sports.
2. You need a routine.
3. You need someone to help you learn to keep fit and to help you to stay motivated.                So, although the Unity Center sounds fantastic and has a great range of facilities, I don’t think it’s the right place for you.

 I think you should start going to the Marathon Gym. It seems to be a very welcoming place and you can get personalized help. That’s what you really need.
I’m so proud that you are taking control of your own health and fitness, Youssef. I’m sure you’ll be successful and I’ll soon see a new you.

Have fun at the gym!

"Dear Bro,

Glad to hear from you yesterday. It sounds as if you’re having a good time at uni, but I want to give you some advice.

You have to have a healthy lifestyle if you want to succeed. You miss the food at home and I doubt you’re eating a balanced diet. You should try and eat fruit and vegetables every day, and not snacks.
Work and play hard, but take time to relax. Lie on your bed and stop thinking. It’s not easy, but it’s good for you.

My last advice is to do some exercise three times a week. Go for a good walk or run, perhaps.   Let me know how you get on.

"Hi Ian,

How are you? I just heard about your decision to resign from Stowark Bank. I must say I’d be sad to see you go. If I can do anything to make you change your mind, I will.      Sarah mentioned that you're leaving because of a phobia triggered by the relocation. It might shock you to learn that I also suffered from claustrophobia: I was afraid of being unable to escape from enclosed spaces. I know how it can affect the way you live your life.      I had a lot of the symptoms you must be familiar with: anxiety, sweating, panic attacks, a pounding heart, and so on. I used to do things like avoid long train journeys and stick close to the exit doors at parties. If I spotted that an exit was closed, it would often be enough to trigger some of the symptoms.

It is not easy to deal with, but there are treatments that can help. In my case, a combination of CBT and medication cured the phobia for good. I would recommend you visit your doctor and ask for advice. I would also suggest you learn and practice some relaxation techniques. These can really help in times of panic and anxiety.

Sarah has also mentioned that she wants to offer you promotion, so you might want to reconsider your decision. Give it some thought.

"Award-Winning Translator       

I’ve been trying out the new, award-winning Transformer Translator and I must say I’m very impressed.     

It’s a state-of-the art little gadget; hand-held and easy to use. It does a fine job of translating into 50 languages and has excellent voice-recognition software which corrects your pronunciation. Not only that, but there are plenty of other helpful features too.     

It has the edge over the competition due to all the built-in extras and because of its light weight, although it is more expensive than the solar-powered 2 co. Probably its closest competitor is the Teen Translator which comes in a great range of colors and does a good job of translating into 60 languages.     

However, I think the Transformer, jam-packed with those extra features, outperforms all the other translators on the market and is well-worth the $235 price.

"Dear Mr McDonald,

I'm writing regarding an issue of breach of contract.       
As far as my claim for overtime payment is concerned, my contract clearly states that I should be compensated for weekend work. Furthermore, nothing in the contract allows the company to refuse to pay me for something that is not your fault. In this point, you are very much taking the moral high ground.      

Consequently, TransWorld Enterprises should pay me for working the two weekends and I believe I am within my rights to object to being refused overtime pay. If I do not receive overtime pay, I intend to sue TransWorld Enterprises for damages.

"Dorian, the housekeeper, drew back the heavy damask curtain and let out an ear-piercing scream. Peter Burnstein lay in his bed, stabbed through the heart with a jewel-encrusted dagger. All at once, the room was full of people. Leonora Burnstein collapsed over her husband, in floods of tears.   ‘Peter, Peter,’ she repeated.   ‘Leonora, come away,’ said Jake. ‘It’s no good, he’s gone, come away.’   Jake took control of the situation and called 911 right away.      Before long, the police were on the scene. They poured into the grand, elegant house, their boots thumping loudly across the polished parquet floors. The bedroom filled with crime-scene photographers, who flooded the gloomy interior with the flash of their cameras. The forensic team started their meticulous examinations like vultures picking over a dead animal. Detective Carter heaved a heavy sigh. After years on the job, nothing shocked him any more.   ‘So fill me in on the set-up here,’ Detective Carter asked his officer.   ‘Well, sir,’ the officer replied, ‘the victim is a Mr. Peter Burnstein, 78 years old, oil tycoon. He set up the Deep Ocean Oil Company back in the 60s – the guy’s a multi-millionaire.’   ‘You mean he was a multi-millionaire. What about the wife?’ asked Carter.   ‘Leonora Burnstein – 24 years old, they’ve been married for six months. She was his maid before apparently. And then there’s Jake Harvey who called us. He was Burnstein’s best friend and business associate. And Dorian, she’s the housekeeper who found the body. She’s been with the family for some years and is very upset – too upset to say much yet. As you can see, the window over there has been forced and the safe in the corner has been emptied so it could just have been a break-in.’   Everyone had gathered in the lounge. Leonora stared into space as if she was in a trance, Jake paced up and down in front of the fireplace, and Dorian was sobbing quietly in the corner.   ‘Good morning, my name is Detective Carter. Allow me to extend my deepest sympathies. I realize that this is a difficult time for you but I do need to ask you a few questions. We suspect that Mr. Burnstein was killed at around midnight. We have found signs of a break-in and the safe has been emptied. Did any of you hear anything at that time?’   ‘No, sir,’ Jake replied. ‘I was round for dinner last night. Peter went to bed at around 11pm. And I stayed chatting to Leonora about our plans for Peter’s surprise birthday party.’   At this, Leonora burst into tears.   ‘That’s right,’ she added. ‘We talked until 1am and Dorian was there too, weren’t you Dorian?’   ‘Yes, ma-am, I was. I was going to be in charge of organizing the party. And we didn’t hear any noise at all. I can’t believe all the time we were making plans, somebody was…I don’t know how we’ll ever get over this.’ She broke down and buried her face in her hands.   ‘OK, guys, we’ll leave if for now,’ said the detective. ‘It sounds like a break-in that has gone wrong. I’ll be in touch when I have any more information.’      The detective left the room and closed the door behind him. A slow smile came over Leonora’s face.   ‘I think we’ve got away with it,’ she said quietly.   Jake stopped pacing and nodded his head. Dorian’s tears dried up and a look of triumph came over her face.   ‘After all these years, we’ll finally be rich,’ she laughed. ‘We didn’t slip up with our story at all. And those dumb cops have got no idea…’       From where he was standing just the other side of the door, Detective Carter thought to himself, ‘Well, we’ll see about that…’  ",1
"REPORT: GENERAL EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION AT HAYS AND SONS

TERMS OF REFERENCE   
Peter Reynolds, Chief Executive Officer of Hays and Sons, requested this report on general employee satisfaction within the company. This report was prepared and submitted to him by Student’s Name, Human Resources Director, on 19 September.     

PROCEDURE   
A survey was prepared and conducted across a representative cross-section of employees, which totaled 120, 10% of the company. The topics included satisfaction with:   
1 Employee basic package: including pay scale, number of vacation days, sick days and overtime.   
2 Employee advanced package: pension plan, health benefits and shares scheme.   
3 Working environment: office equipment, aims and objectives and appraisal system.   
4 Company structure: management style and lines of reporting. Employees were also asked for any suggestions for improvement in any of the above areas.     

FINDINGS   
1 Employee basic package   
• The majority of employees were satisfied with pay scales, number of vacation days and sick days.   
• Most employees complained that they were regularly expected to work above and beyond their contractual hours of employment.   
2 Employee advanced package   
• Most employees were satisfied with the pension plan, health benefits and shares scheme.   
• Some complained that you have to wait for two years before becoming eligible for the advanced package.   
3 Working environment   
• Most employees were satisfied with office equipment and had a clear understanding of their aims and objectives.
• Most complained that they did not receive enough feedback about their performance because the current appraisal system is too informal.
4 Company structure
• Most employees were satisfied with the management style of the company.
• Some complained that it took a long time for decisions to be made because of the long reporting lines within the company.     

CONCLUSIONS   
1 There is a culture of overtime where employees are expected to work additional hours for no additional pay.   
2 Two years is deemed to be too long to wait to earn eligibility for the employee advanced package.   
3 The current informal appraisal system is not providing adequate feedback to employees about their performance.   
4 Employees have highlighted that the lines of reporting are too long because there are many levels of management within the company through which all major decisions must pass for approval.     

RECOMMENDATIONS 
There follows recommendations for addressing the issues highlighted by the survey.  
 1 Overtime culture   
• Employees in senior positions could lead by example in sticking to contractual hours of employment.   
• Consider some form of ‘days off in lieu of overtime’ scheme to improve morale.   
2 Eligibility for employee advanced package.   
• Allow employees to become eligible for the advanced package after 18 months rather than two years.   
3 Appraisals and performance feedback   
• Overhaul current annual appraisal system to make it more formal and thorough.   
• Introduce additional informal weekly feedback meetings.   
4 Overlong reporting lines   
• Consider allowing more autonomy at lower levels.   
• Remove some levels of management.

"I think it’s fine that people have their own varieties of English.  Everyone has their own style of speaking, and within groups there are patterns that everyone tends to follow.  I think that these choices help create a sense of community, and reflect the culture and views of that group.  Although they might cause difficulties in understanding across groups, that doesn’t mean that we should discourage the use of these words or grammatical constructions.      

I don’t think it’s easy to define the ‘right’ way to speak English, so in my mind, if you can successfully communicate, that’s the most important thing!  ",1

"First of all, both groups are good targets for increasing our market share. Both groups purchase magazines on a regular basis. Furthermore, they both have strong purchasing power. When the two groups are compared, both have their strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, the size of demographic group 2 will fall sharply by 2025. On the other hand, their purchasing power will rise steadily. In comparison, there will only be a slight rise in the purchasing power of demographic group 1. However, the percentage of females in this age group will rise rapidly by 2025. As you can see, developing a new magazine for either demographic group would be profitable. In the end I believe the purchasing power of females 15 to 19 in this chart has been underestimated. I believe their purchasing power will rise dramatically by 2025, and that they represent the best group for us to target with a new magazine.

"Dear Paul,   

One of the biggest things you can do to help with your financial problems is to start reducing the number of times you eat out in a week. You don’t need to completely stop eating at restaurants, but it will certainly help if you limit it to once or twice a week. You should bring your lunch when you can, and try making extra food on the weekends so you have dinner for the rest of the week.   Another thing you can do is begin bringing your own coffee to work. Even if you purchase a nice travel mug, the money you’ll save in one week by making coffee at home will more than pay for the cost of the mug.   
Hope this helps!

Cc:      Subject: Idea for new animal pack      

Dear John      
I’ve had what I think is a good idea for a new addition to our product range. The details are below:      

Title: Endangered and extinct animals There are different levels of endangered animals so the pack could be sorted into these levels. Therefore customers could play sorting games with them or games such as Happy Families. Environmental issues are very popular currently, so I think there would be a good market for this topic. Costs should be similar to Animals of the African Continent as we would be able to re-use many photos rather than paying for copyright. Although we don’t have a picture of a dodo, the most famous of extinct animals, there are probably out of copyright pictures available.      

If you would like to meet and discuss my suggestion, I would be happy to do so. Also, as I have had considerable experience on the African pack and also the Animals of the Americas project, I would be very keen on editing this new pack.      

Best regards...

"Dear Mr. Gibbs,   

We have selected an ad campaign for Century watches which I am sure will impress you.     Many people think that Century is a classic and well-known brand because it has featured in some of the most famous advertising campaigns. While this might be true, it is also true that customers prefer Century because it’s simply the best and most reliable watch maker on the market. That is the reason why Century has managed to be one of the top three watchmakers worldwide.     

Considering Century’s trend of effective advertising, we contemplated the idea of bringing a famous spokesperson into the campaign. We decided, however, that the quality of the watch was more important than celebrity endorsement. For this reason, we decided that the ad would feature a man playing golf. It will be simple and crystal clear but with a slogan that delivers an efficient message. A message not directed to athletes, but directed to each and every man who reads and looks at our ad. “Golf and Century. The perfect team” is a simple message that everyone can understand.     

And that is why our ad will succeed and still follow Century’s style. When you consider that our ad will feature a common man playing golf, you might think it is the wrong choice. However, the secret of our campaign relies on the fact that this man will still inspire taste and elegance.     We look forward to hearing your opinions of the new campaign.     

Yours sincerely,

I have to inform you that we were unable to place you in our upcoming class at Central University. I really enjoyed hearing about your experiences. You have a lot to offer, but at this time there were others that were a better fit for our university. I welcome you to reapply next year for a place as a transfer student.   Thank you for your interest in Central University. We know that you have many choices in your schooling, and we appreciate that you applied to Central. I wish you every success in the future.

"Bungee jumping guidelines       
- Jumping with a licensed operator is safer than with just any random guy with a rope   
- Starting off small is advisable   
- Moving on to bigger jumps gradually is a good idea   
- Checking that the ropes are secure is essential   
- Being scared of heights is not compatible with bungee jumping

"Hi Bobby,   

I hope you realize that by hanging out with those ""tough guys"" you are playing with fire. I mean, is it really worth it to give up your freedom or have a criminal record because you want to make money? What about your future? If I were you I would just go back to school and get your degree. You should concentrate on finishing school so that you can get a job. You're tempting fate by skipping classes to hang out in the city with those older guys who just keep getting in trouble. Is it worth it to go to juvenile detention? Unless you want to spend your life in jail or worse, get killed, I would stop now! I don't know whether or not you'll pay any attention to this but believe me, I'm on your side.

"Dear Mum and Dad

Just a quick message to let you know that I’ve settled in and I’ve already made some friends. 
Today I had to choose my courses for the first year. Some of the courses are compulsory so I’ll be studying English 101, Economics200 and Biology211. I’m looking forward to the English course but I think economics might be a bit boring. 

I have to take either another science or math so I’ve decided to take math as it will be far more useful to me, I think, and will help me with the economics. 

The last choice I had to make was in something they call Human Expression.  I had a choice between another English course, history and religion. I’ve chosen religion as it’s such an important part of our lives. I hope that you approve of my choices. I’m going to work really hard! See you in the vacation.

To start, I’d like to tell you about Doug as a child.  He has always looked forward to this day, as far back as elementary school.  In fact, when his teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he answered without hesitation, ‘I want to be a husband and a father.’  There is no greater achievement for him than to be here today, having achieved the first half of that goal.      

Doug, I hope that your new family endures the years as it has for me and your mother. My greatest wish for you both is that through the years your love for each other will grow so much that years from now you will look back on this day, your wedding day, as the best day of your life.

"While stuck in an elevator recently, I was reminded of a funny story about a pizza delivery man who was also stuck in an elevator. Luckily, my time in the elevator wasn’t as bad as his. You’ll never believe this but…, he had gone to an apartment building to deliver a pizza but had never come back. So his employer called the police. It was days before they found him. It was so alarming that at one point, they almost arrested a butcher because they found blood on his clothes! Anyway, they finally found the guy in a broken elevator. There was a security camera in the elevator, but nobody thought to check it! Anyway, the guy lucked out because he was finally found.     Ironic ending: After he finally made it home the most incredible thing happened. It was the stairs rather than the elevator that he took up to his apartment. But then he was accidentally locked in the stairwell for the night!     Slapstick ending: After they fixed the elevator, it automatically went up to the thirtieth floor and wouldn’t come down again. Then he went to step off it, and he was slammed in the door. The stairs were his preferred way down then—though it was thirty flights. On the last step, he tripped and broke his arm!     Black ending: So the guy gets back into his delivery van and was just turning out of the street when his van got rear-ended and totaled. By another pizza delivery van, of all things. Turned out the people in the building had got so fed up waiting for him to appear that they called a rival firm!

"Unstable gardener kills employer   
Last night Phillip Morris, gardener at the residence of Dave Nelson, stabbed his employer in the chest following an argument.    
The police were told that Morris had no intention of murdering his boss when they started arguing about their gardening plans for the following spring. It was also stated that Mr. Nelson frequently exploded at his staff, including the gardener, and that he was quite unstable. Without a doubt, all the abuse that the gardener suffered had a negative effect on his mental well-being.    

On the night of the stabbing, Mr. Nelson was sitting on the patio outside his home, having just finished a steak dinner. He called Morris to the table to discuss plans for next year’s garden, when he became irrationally angry and began yelling at the man.   Mr. Morris moved towards his employer, telling Nelson that he was being unreasonable, but his boss just laughed. It was then, humiliated, that Morris picked up the knife from the dinner table.   He turned toward Nelson, holding the knife, and stabbed him three times in the chest. Morris was said to have been hysterical while calling the police to turn himself in.  Nelson was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

"America is a large country, and business rules can vary according to culture and geography. For example, the East Coast is traditionally more conservative and formal in dress and manner than the West Coast.      

Appropriate business dress is important. In major cities, wear a suit and tie for formal meetings, and a dress shirt for less formal events. Rural towns and areas with a warm climate tend to have less formal requirements.      

Gift giving is discouraged or limited by many US companies as they can appear to be bribes. A gracious written note or an invitation for a meal is generally acceptable.      

When attending a meal with colleagues, do not use or chew on a toothpick in public as this can be considered rude.      

Many American public places and private homes do not allow smoking. It is important to ask permission to smoke before lighting a cigarette or cigar.

"When examining these two websites, there is clearly one overall winner.  Nileretail.com, while not perfect, is very well built and easy to use, whereas the-shopping-space.com is not.      Concerning usability, nileretail.com has a very easy to navigate site, with advanced search functions and customer generated recommendations.  The-shopping-space.com, on the other hand, is very difficult to use, and features out-of-season merchandise on the home page.  This makes their site much less appealing.     

Additionally, compared to nileretail.com, the-shopping-space.com has very few payment and shipping options.  This, combined with the fact that their customer service is unresponsive, means that there is little reason to use the-shopping-space.com.      

The one area that nileretail.com could stand to improve is their FAQ.  Although it contains that answers to the most common questions, it’s very difficult to find contact information for questions that are more specific. Despite this, they still come out as the clear winner when compared to the-shopping-space.com.

"Dear Mayor Bleak,   

I am writing to you to express my concerns about the new Superstore that is planning to come to our town. I really feel that this will force many small businesses to close down and we will lose that sense of community that says who we are. I would like to stress that our local community strongly opposes the opening of Super-Mart in our town. A survey that was conducted last week showed that 87% of our people are against it.   In the Local News article ""Super-Mart to Set Up Soon"" (7th August) you said that ‘local businesses must learn to compete in order to survive’. However, Super-Mart’s standard operating procedure is to drive out the small, locally-owned businesses that might offer some competition. Their strategy is to price their goods under wholesale prices to bring people into Super-Mart. And since Super-Mart has billions of assets they can follow this strategy for as long as it takes to shut down competing businesses. Nearly every small business in our town will be affected by this: tire stores, hardware stores, food stores, clothing stores, etc.   
Yours sincerely,

"Looking ahead    
No one can tell what the future will bring but one thing seems certain – we’ll all be using even more electronic devices and spending more time connected to cyberspace if current research turns out to be correct.      

Imagine driving with your family for a nice trip out somewhere, but wait – did I say ‘driving’? Maybe ‘hovdriving’ might be a better term for what some experts suggest we’ll be doing in the eco-friendly car of the future! Add to this the cries of ‘Look, Mum and Dad, no hands!’ when your youngest son takes the wheel, and the picture is complete. Young Ali has just helped his father punch in the codes for the GPS autopilot, and now he and the rest of the family can all sit back and watch the miles roll away beneath you.       

Once at your destination, you’re served in the stores and restaurants by staff who all aced their Robotic Intelligence tests and now are there to meet your every request with a smile – no more bad days at the office for these workers, and no more high absenteeism-rates for the owners of the stores. Win-win!      

Back at home after a lovely day out, you and the family relax in the tranquil environment you’ve created through a clever combination of light and color, texture and space. Dad has a teleconference to go to in the morning but as he won’t have to actually leave the house, there’s no need to worry about packing a suitcase.

Picture this; you’re sitting in your favorite restaurant and your waiter Juan clomps his way over to your table. Thing is he’s not human, he’s a service robot. He’s still in his gawky teenage years by the look of him, so future developments will include him looking more humanoid. Hiro Takashi and his team in Asia will be working on this project over the next five years.           Florence is a great example of a dedicated service robot. She works in the health field in Africa. Bobby Mazda hopes they will have developed a personality program for Florence to help with in her future role visiting quarantined patients with contagious diseases. She currently does orderly duties in hospitals even though she’s only two feet tall!            

The final service robot ‘tale’ presented was the robot cat. Major Pettigrew told the conference that by 2050 he will have developed these beauties so they can not only meow and walk with their tail in the air, but also purr, play with balls of wool, and climb the curtains.  That should be fun to see!           

And who knows? Perhaps when the next conference comes round, the title will be ‘Humans in the 22nd century’, presented by Juan and Florence, and their pet robo-cat. Imagine that, if you will!

"My Statue of Liberty      

The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom, whose message resonates not only in America but throughout the whole world. Rarely is a statue and a symbol so well recognized across the globe. Situated on its small island, the Statue of Liberty (officially entitled Liberty Enlightening the World) represents the Roman goddess of freedom from slavery, oppression, and tyranny, Libertas. Her crown has seven spikes, which symbolize the seven seas and seven continents; the fire in her torch illustrates the enlightenment of her people; and the tablet in her hand is marked with the date of the United States Declaration of Independence. No static pose for this great lady- her right foot is raised as she moves forward and her left foot stamps on the broken chains at her feet, which demonstrates the freedom that is enjoyed by all in the United States.      The Statue of Liberty was given to America by the people of France in 1886 to mark its centennial celebrations. It stands on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, and in this way it welcomes visitors, immigrants, and returning Americans traveling by ship. Seldom are you greeted with such an awe-inspiring figure on arriving at your destination. Before the invention of the airplane, this would have been one of the first glimpses of America that many newcomers had. In this way, it stands for hope and opportunity.      

The inscription on the statue best sums up what it means to Americans: ""From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome... Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" It is our ""world-wide welcome"" that defines us as a people - it explains our attitude towards immigration and how we have always greeted newcomers with open arms. A glorious multi-cultural country born of immigrants, this statue embodies our America with its unique rich blend of nationalities, traditions, cultures, and creeds.    
 
 To me, the statue exemplifies not only our past, but also, I hope, our future. In its symbols of liberty are found our true identity and the roots that bind us all together to make one nation. I hope that it is these values that shall define our country in the century that lies ahead.

Sorry it took me so long but my notes were in a bit of a mess and I had to sort them out! So here goes … Listing   Write out in linear form a list of ideas. Don't worry about grammar in the bullet or numerical points. Good for people who are left-brained.      

Webbing   Same as clustering, or diagramming. Non-linear ways of putting down your ideas about a topic. Start by writing down a key word on a blank piece of paper; put the word in a circle. Respond to that word using subheadings, which can also be circled or boxed. Use arrows / lines to show relationships between details.      

Questioning   Imagine the questions your readers have about the topic. Use open ended questions like who, where, what, why, when and how.      

Cubing   Look at topic from six sides. Spend 3-5 minutes exploring each of the 'sides'. First you describe it; then analyze it. Next compare and associate it. Then apply it, and finally argue both sides of it.      

Hope this helps. Perhaps you can return the favor sometime?

"There are many reasons for industrial espionage.  Sometimes, employees feel that they've been treated unfairly, or that the company has taken advantage of them.  Other times, they're being blackmailed or bribed by a competitor, and are afraid of the consequences of saying no.     The first type of industrial espionage is the stealing of trade secrets.  This happens when confidential information about unique products, services, or strategy is leaked by an informant or discovered through malicious computer hacking. The second type is stealing financial information which can be used for insider trading. Finally, there is the theft of intellectual property, such as diagrams, plans, or technical specifications for a new product.  All of these can be devastating for the company, and are unethical and illegal.

RE: Recommendation for new product   

After reviewing the newest proposals I recommend investing in the Fast Dry Towel Rack. Based on our market, the Fast Dry will appeal to many people. It ranks highest in the criteria for practicality, ease of use, uniqueness and price. It is also a product that everybody needs and it takes the old towel rack a step higher. If we were to develop this product, I suggest the following step-by-step instructions.   

First, take the Fast Dry towel rack out of the box. Next, screw Fast Dry to the desired wall in your bathroom. After it is secured on the wall, plug it into an electrical socket.   When you are ready to use Fast Dry, place your wet towel over the rack. Then, push the ON button. Fast Dry will automatically turn off when your towel is dry.

"Leprechauns have a long history as a part of Irish folklore, and are considered to be very lucky, if reclusive creatures.  They are often pictured as very short, close to a child’s height, with a red beard.  They are usually shown wearing a green suit, with pointed shoes.      

Legend says that these leprechauns hide all of their gold in pots at the end of rainbows, and those who can find it will be rich.  It’s also believed that if a human catches a leprechaun, the leprechaun has the power to grant three wishes to the human in exchange for letting him free.      

While there have been very few reported sightings of leprechauns in the modern day, these creatures are a common theme in children’s stories, and often mentioned at the sight of a rainbow.

"I just listened to the song 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward. It's a folk-rock tune, and I think it's pretty catchy. I listened to it five times, and I can't get it out my head. Josh's voice is rough and edgy. He doesn't have much of a range, but he hits a few high notes. I was also a little confused. The mood of the song is kind of happy because of the quick, addictive beat. But I think that the lyrics are political, sad and sentimental. Very interesting! I recommend this music when you want a beat and some politics in one song.

Subject: Your questions about the company  

Hi, Jessica. 

Thanks for your email. I've provided answers to all of your questions. The answer to your first question about the environment is that it's a pretty serious work atmosphere. All employees have to wear business attire every day, and everyone has their own cubicle. In answer to your final question about work-life balance, most people here work 40 hours a week, more or less.  I get about three weeks' vacation each year. And yes, people here do socialize together sometimes. The area around the office is great for eating and shopping, and there are plenty of places to have lunch.

 See you soon! Jessica

"Hi, Ruby. 

In the meeting on Monday, we talked about our future strategy, and I have some comments I'd like to share.  First, there's a lot of competition in our industry, and I think we're in danger of falling behind. Our competitor is working on a revolutionary new mobile app. We'll need to invest more in our research and development departments in order to compete. There's one other thing I wanted to mention. We'll be bringing in 20 new members to our marketing department. I have some concerns about the training sessions because it's such a large group. If we can, we should get Patty to do the training. She did a great job with the new recruits last year. Let me know what you think.

If you are going, should we postpone the company meeting until you have returned?

Who is looking into that? I'd really appreciate it if you could get back to me in the next week.

"Francis and I recently ate at a new restaurant called 1876. I had called to make reservations, and the employee was very friendly. She put us down for a 7 p.m. reservation. When we arrived, the place looked beautiful. There were candles everywhere, and the server gave us a fantastic, free appetizer. I ordered the asparagus quiche, and it came with a side of spicy corn on the cob. It was unbelievable! As soon as we finished the main course, we both ordered the cheesecake brownie. It was two classic desserts in one! The food was definitely not low-fat, but the chef said that it's mostly local and organic. Everything was delicious and unusual, so we'll probably go again.

"I'll never forget the first house my husband and I bought. It was very small, but we really loved it. The price was $240,000. We didn't have that much money, so we made an offer of $200,000. The owner made a counteroffer of $230,000. We said that we were sorry, but we just didn't have the money. We also told the owner how much we loved the house and wished her good luck. We continued to look at other houses, but couldn't find anything we loved. Then, suddenly, we heard from the owner. The house was ours for $200,000. I asked her why. She said that one other couple had offered more, but she decided to sell it to us because we loved the house so much. We were very happy in that house.

Here's a summary of the meeting we had this morning with Judy.

"Carla, I'd be glad to help you with the company's financial problems. 

Here are my ideas. First, I recommend offering older workers a big retirement bonus with medical coverage for six months. I think that about 100 workers would take the offer. Second, I propose that we stop all new hiring. We can use attrition to reduce staff size. I think that in a few months, we could cut our staff by about 40 workers. Next, we should cut the number of hours that everyone works to 35 hours per week. This would include everyone, even the big executives. Only as a last resort should we have layoffs. That would be very bad for company morale.

It's so interesting to hear about all the changes in your life! My family life has changed quite a bit too.

"Not all states in the US prohibit talking on your cellphone while driving, but my state does. In California, it's illegal to hold a mobile phone and talk on it while driving. You can use a hands-free device. For example, using a speakerphone is permitted. To my mind, this is a good law. A driver cannot react quickly if they are holding a cellphone. Personally, I think all states should have a law like this. In my opinion, it would save lives.

"When I was growing up, I read books printed on paper. I'd read anything –  graphic novels; autobiographies; nature magazines; and my favorite, crime fiction. Somewhere along the way, I've transitioned from paper to electronic media. In the early 2000s, I read my first e-book. It was a 1930s classic: 'Their Eyes Were Watching God,' written by Zora Neale Hurston, written before digital communications media was even born. Now, I read my novels and news on a tablet. I do research for work on search engines, blogs, magazines and online dictionaries.     I've noticed some huge differences in my habits, too. With paper media, I would use my fingers to turn a page; with electronic media, I tap or swipe my screen to go to the next page. Sometimes news articles contain links. I can tap the link and be taken to an entirely new world of information. In fact, I do a different finger dance made from a complex series of taps and swipes to accomplish certain goals. None of this was possible with paper books and, frankly, sometimes all this digital interaction can become a little distracting. In all, however, I enjoy it.

"What makes a successful leader is hard to define. Take me, for example. Most of my adult life I was more of a follower than a leader. I've always had a hard time persuading others, and I lack most of the characteristics that we associate with a strong leader, like charisma and drive. It wasn't until five years ago, when I was hired by a new company and ended up in a management training course, that things began to change for me. At first, I thought I would never be able to develop leadership qualities. Among the biggest challenges for me was just feeling comfortable in front of a large group. But the leader of the course earned my trust and, before I knew it, I was being asked to help others. Now I'm the manager of my department, and my boss is very happy with my performance. I don't think I'm the best leader in the world, but my staff respects me and I feel confident. The most important thing that I've learned is this: Never underestimate yourself.

Here are some tips for writing effective emails: 

• Use bullet points.
• Make subject lines clear and concise.
• Check any attachments before you hit 'Send.' A good expression to use is 'Please find attached …' 
 • Use the expressions are 'I'm forwarding …' and 'Please don't hesitate to contact me.' 
• Be polite. Avoid too much humor or sarcasm. This can easily be misunderstood.
 • Be very careful with emoticons.

"Harry,

Here are some ideas for motivating your employees. I also included some things to avoid. 
• Incentivize your employees. Make them feel that the company's success means success for them as well. There's nothing like a possible reward to motivate people.
 • Take an active interest in your employees' career paths. Offer them additional training and act as their mentor.
• Emphasize a healthy work-life balance. Recognize that employees have lives outside the company. 
• Listen to your employees. If people feel like they are being heard, even when they are complaining, they will be happier and more productive. 
• Treat subordinates the way you would like to be treated by your superiors.     

Here are five ways to demotivate your staff: 
• Disrespect subordinates because they are below you.
• Take credit or claim responsibility for work done by your subordinates.
• Lose your temper.
• Let employees unfairly take the blame for things.
• Don't compliment or praise people for good work. 

Good luck with your team!

"Dear Mark,

How are you doing? I've been doing well. I had an amazing experience last week.

I had tickets to go to a rock concert by the band Carthago on Saturday. We were waiting in an endless line to get into the concert hall. I was feeling impatient and restless, so I walked up to the front of the line. Unbelievably, there was a manager who was giving out five backstage passes, and I got one! I was so excited that I flew back to my friends in line and jumped up and down with excitement. During intermission, I went to a special stage door and was let in by a big, muscled security guy. Finally, they let the five pass winners into the large room where the band members were relaxing. We all just nervously introduced ourselves and chatted about the music for about 10 minutes. Then we were escorted out. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. So amazing! I guess I was just in the right place at the right time. 

Maybe the next time you're in town, we can see a concert together. Until then, keep in touch.

"Corporate social responsibility has become something of a buzzword, and I believe it's something that global companies can no longer afford to ignore.           It is an undeniable fact that any activity in which companies give back to the community has a long-lasting, positive impact on millions of people throughout the world, providing opportunities and transforming lives. It is equally true and important to spell out that companies that run or contribute toward such programs know that it makes good business sense to do so, both for PR purposes and to open up new markets and create new customers. 

CSR critics may argue that it costs too much money, which goes against good business practice. While the cost is a reality, it's also evident that CSR is not about winners and losers. When done properly, it is a win-win situation. The reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit from CSR programs. 

To sum up, businesses should not be afraid to start a CSR program that will both make their shareholders happy and give new opportunities to the community. They all move forward together. It is indeed a win-win business model.

"NAFTA is a trade agreement among the three countries in North America. Indeed, NAFTA stands for the North American Free Trade Agreement. It has become a dominant force in trade relations among Mexico, Canada and the United States. 

The NAFTA treaty came into force in January 1994, after years of hard negotiations. The primary effect of NAFTA was to greatly reduce or even eliminate tariffs on goods and services moving among Mexico, Canada and the United States. Since the implementation of NAFTA, trade has indeed increased in North America. This is especially true in agriculture. 

The agreement has not been without controversy, however. Because not all goods and services are free of tariffs, there are continual disagreements and negotiations. Each of the three countries in the agreement tries to gain an advantage for their exports. For example, in the American Southwest, farmers complain about the entry of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the United States. They worry that this reduces prices of their own produce. 

Overall, however, NAFTA has had a beneficial effect on the three countries involved. It has greatly stimulated international trade in the region.

"The purpose of this report is to compare two training companies and recommend one of them as our potential provider.

The first company, TrainQuick, is relatively cheap, and a flexible training schedule is provided. However, their service is being implemented at another of our branches, and reports from there suggest employees are not attending the classes in large numbers because classes consist of a mix of employees from different branches. The staff would prefer studying only with their own branch members.

The second company, Skills Pro, provides a more expensive service, and the course has been described as difficult. However, this should not be seen as a potential drawback. In fact, the course is generally finished successfully, and the company is planning to further expand its courses.
In short, we are all in agreement that Skills Pro should be chosen as our training service provider. Despite the higher costs, a higher quality of service with more successful results is guaranteed, although further research should be done before any investment is made.

"Hi, Samantha.

Here are some details regarding my plan for the presentation at the next company meeting.

I was thinking that in the opening we mention our key achievement from the last quarter – the renewal of our partnership with Crum Industries. Also, it might be nice if I touched on how our team has been praised by Crum for how dedicated we are to quality.

Then, in the body of the speech, I'm considering starting with the problems we faced with Crum three months ago then transition to how we tackled them. The main issue we were facing was the unresolved defects affecting Crum's clients. I can also mention the other tech issues in passing. When I talk about the solutions, I'm seeing an opportunity to cover how it was only multi-team collaboration that allowed us to make all the necessary fixes.

Toward the closing, it would be best to include something about how we will require more support in order to make sure we avoid further problems with other customers.

It took  our dedicated group of people  the whole quarter to fix  the defects  and  stop the house from falling down .

"Some of my friends who are studying English impress me with their large vocabulary because I hear them use difficult words like 'discombobulate' or 'averse.' I rarely hear native speakers using words like that. Some of them use advanced phrases, like 'I could be wrong,' 'one thought I have that you may find naive' before their true opinion, and sometimes I feel like I'm listening to a diplomat.

One of my friends is happy that she managed to use vocabulary in real life that she had learned from reading English articles, but she said it wasn't as easy as she'd imagined. She's also glad that she's gotten the hang of using formal and polite language, which she'd heard in speeches by directors and VPs.

Sometimes though, it seems that my friends use words that are too formal for a team presentation. Next time, when they pick up a new word, they should pay attention to whether native speakers use it only in formal speaking or writing. And another thing they need to do is to reassess their use of polite phrases, like if they've used too many in the past and should reduce their use a bit so they don't lose their audience before getting to the main point.

"My favorite city is Palm Springs, California in the United States. It's only about two hours east of Los Angeles by car, but there are a number of differences between these two Southern California cities.

Palm Springs is a small city with a population of around 40,000. It's a desert city famous for its hot springs, spas, golf courses, stylish hotels, and laid back lifestyle. It is also considered the epicenter of midcentury-modern architecture in the US. The downtown area is filled with tourists visiting hip boutiques and trendy restaurants. The surrounding Coachella Valley offers everything from rock climbing to horseback riding.

Los Angeles is a bustling city of approximately 4 million people located on the Pacific Ocean. It is probably best known for its beautiful beaches and as the home to Hollywood, the center of the country's film industry. The city has a diverse economy beyond entertainment, including education, technology and medicine. Like Palm Springs, LA, as it is known, hosts large numbers of tourists every year.

So, if you're ever in LA, you might want to consider a side trip to the desert. A two-hour car ride can show you a whole different side of Southern California.

"Josh and Ken,

I've read your proposals and thought a lot about them, and I think that I have a proposal that's a good compromise. Just north of downtown is a new office building with unoccupied shops on the first floor. It's a little sad and empty now, but a few shops are starting to move in. Because the empty spaces aren't generating any revenue for the building's owner, Cape Compass Construction Inc., they are signing fairly long-term leases, like seven years, at reasonable rents. I asked the building manager about a nice space that's about 100 square meters smaller than what we have now. She'd let us have it for $25,000 a year, less than half of what we're paying now. Of course, the big disadvantage is that it's not downtown, so our customers would have to walk an extra four or five blocks to visit us. We would probably lose some long-term clients. However, the new office building will eventually have about 2,000 employees and they'll need clothes that are suitable for business, just what we provide!

"Robots help perform more than 300,000 surgeries per year in the US. They explore places humans can't, such as the deepest parts of oceans and space. But most often, robots perform routine, assembly-line jobs that increase productivity and lower costs, like packaging produce or attaching wheels to cars.

Robots perform an increasingly large proportion of menial tasks in the US, which I feel is a promising trend. The result is that companies can keep more jobs in the country and increase the number of jobs that require higher-level skills. Jobs that require these skills will still need to be performed by humans, at least in the foreseeable future.

I think there is a major downside to this trend, however. As robots replace people doing manual work that can be completed by computers – jobs usually held by poor and middle-class people – the line that separates the poor and rich will become that much more evident. As this trend continues, we need to figure out how to add robots to create an optimal workforce instead of using them simply to replace humans.

"I don't want to name names, but there is a certain male singer who I think is nothing but a media-hogging opportunist. He loves to champion the cause of Housing for Humanity, the charity that builds affordable homes for the poor, but I know something that many people don't.

He arrived with all sorts of assistants and media people. He gave interviews to the local media and talked about how important this charity was to him. As soon as the interviews were over, he left. My friend said he didn't hit one nail!

"I believe that the creative writing techniques introduced here could be useful for many types of writing. In my line of work, the 'questioning' technique comes in handy. I use it so often and so instinctively that I have to admit that I no longer think of it as a technique. You see, I write technology articles for a weekly banking magazine and use a common journalistic approach: answering the five 'wh-' questions as you write the first paragraph of the story. That way, you anticipate the most salient questions your readers might have about the story.      A technique I'd like to formally experiment with is loop writing. Sometimes, when I'm trying to formulate the first, critical paragraph for my story, it's difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. I don't always know what the most relevant information is until I sort through all of the details. Loop writing would allow me to think through all of the details, summarize them, rethink them and summarize them again. I believe that final summary could give me a jump-start on a powerful lead paragraph.

"In my country, the process of finding the right home and then financing it can be a real nightmare.

Before people can actually look for a home, they need to sit down with a mortgage broker from a bank. You need to be 'pre-approved' for a loan so you can actually make an offer on a home if you find one. The process can be very long and complicated, requiring an incredible amount of paperwork and supporting documents. One thing that can make the process easier for people is if they have some extra cash to put down in advance.

When people are finally ready to start looking, they can contact a real estate broker. He or she will show several homes, which can take weeks or months. If you take too long to make an offer on a place you like, someone else might purchase it before you have a chance. However, if you're lucky enough to find a place you like, and your offer is accepted, owning your own home can make all the headaches well worth it.

As for the girl you're seeing, I hope you guys can work things out. You're a great couple. Don't fall into the trap of giving up whenever there's a rough spot. If you can get through the difficult times, your bond will be stronger in the end. I know relationships can be hard work, but they can enhance life.

"Leprechauns have a long history as a part of Irish folklore, and are considered to be lucky, if very reclusive, creatures. They are often pictured as very short, closer to a child's height than an adult's, with bright red hair and a red beard. They are usually shown wearing a green suit and narrow, pointed shoes.       Legend has it that leprechauns hide all of their gold in pots at the end of rainbows, and those who can find it will be rich. It's also believed by some that if a human catches a leprechaun, the leprechaun has the power to grant three wishes to the human, in exchange for the leprechaun's freedom.

While there have been no reported sightings of leprechauns in modern times, these creatures are a common theme in children's stories and are often mentioned at the sight of a rainbow.

Whether or not you actually believe in the existence of creatures such as leprechauns, they are certainly an interesting aspect of the history and culture of a country. So much so that, in modern times, you will be more likely to see them in the advertising material for tourist attractions than at the end of a rainbow!
